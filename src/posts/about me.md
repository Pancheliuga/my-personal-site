Hi, I'm Oleksandr Pancheliuga â€” a geospatial data/GIS analyst â€” based in Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦. I'm skilled in spatial data processing and analysis, remote sensing/earth observations, web map development, and data visualization.

After graduating Master's degree in Geographic information systems and technologies ([National university of water and environmental engineering](https://nuwm.edu.ua/en/), 2008), I started my own company. 

I have worked in the Ukrainian land management and cadastre system for over a decade. During that time, I primarily focused on implementing new geospatial technology in our industries.

Over these years, I combined both CEO and GIS roles, which has given me a lot of experience from developing responsive and market-driven company to land surveying.

I enjoy working on cutting-edge projects and enabling new geospatial technologies that directly impact our lives. I also enjoy being surrounded by brilliant people in the geo community. I'm always attentive to new challenges and search for opportunities that allow me to grow professionally. 

My specialization and interests are focused on:
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- Remote sensing/earth observations
- Spatial data analysis
- Data science
- Web map development

Listed below are some of the technologies I use:
- Programming languages: Python, Javascript
- Remote sensing/GIS: Google Earth Engine (JS and Python APIs), OGR/GDAL, QGIS
- Python packages: pandas, geopandas, geopy, osmnx, matplotlib, geemap, numpy, rasterio, xarray, folium, pyplot
- Web development: Streamlit, Google Earth Engine Apps, HTML, CSS, Jamstack 

Lately, I have devoted myself to improving my soft and hard skills and launched this website. You can read more about it in this [post](https://pancheliuga.com/blog/the-very-first-post/).
