Over these years, I have worked on both extremely large projects for huge organisations and tiny projects for small startups. This has given me a lot of experience over a large variety of project types. It also means I’ve worked with a lot of teams in various sizes—each with their own constraints and goals. These projects vary between design systems, creative campaign work and good ol’ websites.

I mostly specialise in CSS—whether that is writing a course for Google, co-authoring a book on CSS layout, or creating a methodology to help people write better CSS. Most of my client work involves me applying this experience to help teams write better CSS—often by helping them create a design system.

You can read more about me over on my personal blog, or catch up with me on Twitter, CodePen or Github.
