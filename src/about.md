Hi, I'm Oleksandr Pancheliuga — a geospatial / GIS data analyst — based in Ukraine 🇺🇦. I'm skilled in spatial data processing and analysis, remote sensing, web tool development, and data visualization.

After graduating Master's degree in Geographic information systems and technologies ([National university of water and environmental engineering](https://nuwm.edu.ua/en/), 2008), I started my own company. 

I have worked in the Ukrainian land management and cadastre system for over a decade. During that time, I primarily focused on implementing new geospatial technology in our industries.

Over these years, I combined both CEO and GIS roles, which has given me a lot of experience from developing responsive and market-driven company to land surveying.

I enjoy working on cutting-edge projects and enabling new geospatial technologies that directly impact our lives. I also enjoy being surrounded by brilliant people in the geo community. 

So lately, I have devoted myself to improving my soft and hard skills and launched this website. You can read more about it in this [post](https://pancheliuga.com/blog/the-very-first-post/).
